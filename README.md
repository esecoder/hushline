# Hush Line ðŸ¤«

Hush Line deploys to either an onion-only instance or Tor + public web. It's a web and email server and a Python app that encrypts a message with your public PGP key once a message gets submitted, then saves it, and finally emails the encrypted message to you. Your data never gets saved in an unencrypted state. And since all messages are sent to your email, you never have to log in to the device.
