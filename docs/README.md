### Step 1: Install Raspberry Pi OS
1. Download the official Raspberry Pi Imager: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
2. Install Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) to a micro SD card.

### Step 2: Log in to your Pi
1. Open a Terminal, and log in to your Pi using SSH:
```
ssh pi@<IP>
```
2. We'll install Hush Line as root:
```
sudo su
```

### Step 3: Install Hush Line

1. To install Hush Line, simply execute the following command:
```
curl -sSL https://install.hushline.app | bash
```

### Step 4: Email Notifications

1. To receive tip notifications you'll need an SMTP-compatible email service. We're using Gmail in our example and need the following information:
- Gmail address
- SMTP address: smtp.gmail.com
- [App password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)
- Port: 465
- If our Gmail address is myburneremail@gmail.com, email notifications would be delivered to that Gmail account.
  - Remember that you can choose to forward messages to any address in your Gmail settings.

### Step 5: Create and add your PGP key

#### MacOS

1. Download and install [GPG Suite](https://gpgtools.org/).
2. Open GPG Keychain.
3. Click "New" at the top of the window.
4. Create a key for the email address of your tip line. _You do not have to use your notification email address_. Science & Design uses "tips@scidsg.org" for our purposes. It's critical to enter an email address that you own which can receive a confirmation email.
5. After creating your key, choose to upload it to a public keyserver. You'll need to confirm your email address before it finishes uploading. 
6. On the appropriate prompt during install, enter the address of your uploaded key. For example, for our key seen at https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=demo@scidsg.org, we would enter https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/D278DD437B275C8668989A4B425C6C74405C3EB1 into the appropriate prompt.

### Step 6: Access Hush Line

1. When the installation completes, you'll see your Hush Line address:
