### Step 1: Install Raspberry Pi OS
1. Download and open the official Raspberry Pi Imager: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
2. Choose Raspberry Pi OS (other) > Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit).
3. If you have an SD card slot on your computer, insert your card. Otherwise, plug your adapter into a USB port and insert your card. 
4. Next, click storage and select your micro SD card.
5. Before writing the operating system to the card, click the Settings button in the bottom-right of the window.
   - Enable SSH and create a strong password.
   - Add your Wi-Fi information.
   - Adjust other settings as desired.
6. Click "Write".

### Step 2: Log in to your Pi
#### Router Settings
1. Find your IP address by booting up your Pi. Wait a couple of minutes for it to boot up completely.
2. Go to your router admin settings and look for your connected devices. Your device should be named "raspberrypi."
3. Take note of its IP address. Its format might look like "192.168.0.4."
4. Next, look for "IP Reservations" in your router settings. It may also be called "Static IP Addresses." Sometimes, when your router or device reboots, it gets assigned a different IP address. We want to assign your device an IP so you can have a predictable path to log back into your device.

#### Raspberry Pi   
1. Open a Terminal, and log in to your Pi using SSH:
```
ssh pi@<IP>
```
2. We'll install Hush Line as root:
```
sudo su
```

### Step 3: Install Hush Line

1. To install Hush Line, execute the following command:
```
curl -sSL https://install.hushline.app | bash
```

### Step 4: Email Notifications

1. To receive tip notifications, you'll need an SMTP-compatible email service. We're using Gmail in our example and need the following information:
- Gmail address
- SMTP address: smtp.gmail.com
- [App password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)
- Port: 465
- If our Gmail address is myburneremail@gmail.com, email notifications will be delivered to that Gmail account.
  - Remember that you can forward messages to any address in your Gmail settings.

### Step 5: Create and add your PGP key

#### MacOS

1. Download and install [GPG Suite](https://gpgtools.org/).
2. Open GPG Keychain.
3. Click "New" at the top of the window.
4. Create a key for the email address of your tip line. _You do not have to use your notification email address_. Science & Design uses "tips@scidsg.org" for our purposes. It's critical to enter an email address you own that can receive a confirmation email.
5. After creating your key, choose to upload it to a public keyserver. You'll need to confirm your email address before it finishes uploading. 
6. On the appropriate prompt during installation, enter the address of your uploaded key. For example, for our key seen at https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=demo@scidsg.org, we would enter https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/D278DD437B275C8668989A4B425C6C74405C3EB1 into the appropriate prompt.

### Step 6: Access Hush Line

1. When the installation completes, you'll see your Hush Line address:
